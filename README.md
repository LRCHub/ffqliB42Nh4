[00:02.99] We don't talk anymore
[00:06.18] We don't talk anymore
[00:08.25] We don't talk anymore
[00:09.99] Like we used to do
[00:13.24] We don't love anymore
[00:15.63] What was all of it for?
[00:17.62] Oh, we don't talk anymore
[00:20.09] Like we used to do
[00:29.09] 
[00:23.08] I just heard you found the one you've been looking
[00:26.45] You've been looking for
[00:29.07] I wish I would have known that wasn't me
[00:32.65] 'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
[00:36.34] Why I can't move on
[00:38.71] Just the way you did so easily?
[00:54.21] 
[00:42.37] Don't wanna know
[00:43.91] What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
[00:46.68] If he's holding onto you so tight
[00:49.33] The way I did before
[00:52.08] I overdosed
[00:53.62] Should've known your love was a game
[00:56.34] Now I can't get you out of my brain
[00:58.63] Oh, it's such a shame
[01:09.13] 
[01:01.41] That we don't talk anymore
[01:03.46] We don't talk anymore
[01:05.86] We don't talk anymore
[01:07.55] Like we used to do
[01:10.72] We don't love anymore
[01:13.18] What was all of it for?
[01:15.52] Oh, we don't talk anymore
[01:17.49] Like we used to do
[01:26.49] 
[01:20.24] I just hope you're lying next to somebody
[01:23.63] Who knows how to love you like me
[01:26.48] There must be a good reason that you're gone
[01:30.09] Every now and then I think you
[01:33.10] Might want me to come show up at your door
[01:34.61] But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
[01:55.61] 
[01:39.93] Don't wanna know
[01:41.92] If you're looking into her eyes
[01:44.41] If she's holding onto you so tight
[01:46.89] The way I did before
[01:49.57] I overdosed
[01:51.56] Should've known your love was a game
[01:54.34] Now I can't get you out of my brain
[01:56.21] Ooh, it's such a shame
[02:07.21] 
[01:59.17] That we don't talk anymore (we don't, we don't)
[02:01.12] We don't talk anymore (we don't, we don't)
[02:03.82] We don't talk anymore
[02:05.54] Like we used to do
[02:08.75] We don't love anymore (we don't, we don't)
[02:11.32] What was all of it for? (We don't, we don't)
[02:12.75] Oh, we don't talk anymore
[02:15.38] Like we used to do
[02:24.38] 
[02:26.13] Like we used to do
[02:35.13] 
[02:36.47] Don't wanna know
[02:39.15] What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
[02:41.59] If he's giving it to you just right
[02:44.23] The way I did before
[02:47.06] I overdosed
[02:49.17] Should've known your love was a game
[02:51.75] Now I can't get you out of my brain
[02:54.26] Oh, it's such a shame
[03:04.76] 
[02:57.00] That we don't talk anymore (we don't, we don't)
[02:57.97] We don't talk anymore (we don't, we don't)
[02:59.13] We don't talk anymore

[03:08.76] What was all of it for? (we don't, we don't)
[03:10.33] Oh, we don't talk anymore
[03:12.31] Like we used to do
[03:21.31] 
[03:15.25] (We don't talk anymore) Don't wanna know
[03:18.31] What kind of dress you're wearing tonight (oh)
[03:19.97] If he's holding onto you so tight (oh)
[03:22.11] The way I did before
[03:24.96] (We don't talk anymore) I overdosed
[03:28.28] Should've known your love was a game (oh)
[03:29.89] Now I can't get you out of my brain (woah)
[03:31.87] Ooh, it's such a shame
[03:34.11] We don't talk anymore
